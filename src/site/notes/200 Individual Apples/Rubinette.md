Rubinette is moderately good-looking, with characteristic orange and dull red streaks over a light green/yellow background.  The apples are generally small to medium-sized.  Overall the appearance is attractive but in a rather subdued sort of way.

The parentage is [Golden Delicious](https://www.orangepippin.com/varieties/apples/golden-delicious) pollinated by (probably) [Cox's Orange Pippin](https://www.orangepippin.com/varieties/apples/coxs-orange-pippin) - a very popular combination with other growers over the years.

### Summary from [[Sources and Documentation/YT Vid A Look at Some Parent Apples That I use\|Apple Parents Video]]

Good sugar acid balance, good apple, used in past as a parent, but likely will discontinue use since it hasn't "wowed" in the last few seasons.
