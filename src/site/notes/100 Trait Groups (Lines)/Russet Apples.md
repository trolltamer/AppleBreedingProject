>**RUSSETS:** 
>Russets can vary a lot in flavor and other characteristics, but there is something of a classic russet character found in apples like Ashmeadâ€™s Kernel, Golden Russet and Roxbury Russet. These genes have been un-selected for a long time by large apple breeding operations, to the point that they are rare now, except among amateur growers and small specialty orchards. We should not only save the russets, but continue to develop them into even better and more diverse fruits. In particular, I think crossing them with savory apples like Wickson and Muscat de Venus is likely to yield amazing results. We shall see. The crosses are made and the seeds being planted!
