There is no SkillCult Project Page on Crab Apple Genetics, but it is a mentioned subsection in the apple breeding project page:

>**CRAB APPLE GENETICS:** 
>Most will think of crab apples as bitter and sour. Many crabs actually have unique traits that can be carried over into other apples in breeding. The unique savory flavor of Wickson and other apples in that breeding line are good examples. The extreme crispness of the popular Honey Crisp came from the Malus Prunifolia crab. Apples with crab genes, such as Wickson, Chestnut Crab and Centennial are popular and frequently make it onto peopleâ€™s favorites list. Not uncommonly, they are at the top of that list.
