# Summary



## Notes from SkillCult Homestead
### Summary from [[Sources and Documentation/YT Vid A Look at Some Parent Apples That I use\|Apple Parents Video]]
Summer/Early apple, similar to [[200 Individual Apples/Wickson\|Wickson]] in its intensity of flavor and has some of the "crab" quality, but is not bitter. Outstanding apple and is very early ripening.
