## Notes from SkillCult Homestead

### Summary from [[Sources and Documentation/YT Vid A Look at Some Parent Apples That I use\|Apple Parents Video]]

Dark red skin, good keeper, beautiful apple. High sugar content when ripe, extremely rich flavor, "red apple flavor", also slightly spiced cider(apple juice) flavor. Exceptional overall apple. Possibly some genetic overlap or synergy between the dark red skin pigment genes and the [[100 Trait Groups (Lines)/Red Fleshed Apples\|Red Fleshed Apples]] genes.
