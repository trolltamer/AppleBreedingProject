# Summary

>[!quote] [Wickson variety summary from orangepippin.com](https://www.orangepippin.com/varieties/crab-apples/wickson-crab)
>Like most crab-apples Wickson is very small, and is also a hardy and problem-free tree.  However that is where the resemblance to other crab-apples ends.  Wickson is unusually sweet, but at the same time has a strong acid component.  The result is an apple which has a very strong flavor, making it an excellent component for cider blends.  (This flavor of course tends to encourage the view that Spiztzenburg and Newtown Pippin might be involved somewhere in the parentage, as these apples both have pronounced flavors).


## Notes from SkillCult Homestead

### Summary from [[Sources and Documentation/YT Vid A Look at Some Parent Apples That I use\|Apple Parents Video]]

"This apple is in a class by itself". Not meaning that it is better than other apples, just that apples are so varied they cannot be compared, also different seasonality, etc.

Wickson is in a class all its own, can allegedly reach up to 25% sugar, which is unheard of for apples. Extremely flavorful, has its own unique "wickson-thing" flavor that kind of goes along with a mouthfeel, almost an effervescent quality. Also has savory flavors. Has been mixed into many different lines for its flavorful, high-sugar, effervescent qualities.
