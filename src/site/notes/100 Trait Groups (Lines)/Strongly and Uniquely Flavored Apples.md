>**STRONGLY AND UNIQUELY FLAVORED APPLES:** 
>We are at a point where collecting apples is easier and easier. So I have grown and tried quite a few. Among them are occasional apples with very strong and/or complex and unique flavors. These flavors can be transferred into other apples by breeding. I am crossing them with into other apples to carry the flavor forward and also crossing some of them together to double down on those flavor genes! I feel sure this will yield results if we keep doing it. I already have seedling fruits that have inherited high flavor or unique flavors. I have a cherry flavored apple and a few that have very strong fruit candy flavors. Also, many red fleshed apples have strong and complex fruit flavors. In the future, we will have very strongly flavored improved apples with flavors like Watermelon, Banana, Berries, Cherry, Citrus, Pine and more. We just need to keep doing the work.
