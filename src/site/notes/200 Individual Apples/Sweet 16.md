### Summary from [[Sources and Documentation/YT Vid A Look at Some Parent Apples That I use\|Apple Parents Video]]

Can be strongly flavored, almost to a negative degree at times, contains many disparate flavors. One of the most intensely "in your face" flavored apple, but nasty when overripe. Flavors of anise, almond, cherry, "candy-like". Contains many different intense flavors, interested in using as a parent for adding flavor to other dessert apples.
