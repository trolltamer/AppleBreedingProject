# Summary



## Notes from SkillCult Homestead
### Summary from [[Sources and Documentation/YT Vid A Look at Some Parent Apples That I use\|Apple Parents Video]]
Excellent dessert apple, outstanding texture, mild honey-like flavors, along with a little bit of the red fleshed "berry" flavor, but not as intensely as some of the other apples, as it's not as red fleshed. The best eating apple out of the red fleshed apples. Also hangs late, is ready to be picked off tree in December.
