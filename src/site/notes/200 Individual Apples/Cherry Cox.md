# Summary

Cherry Cox is a sport of [[Cox's Orange Pippin\|Cox's Orange Pippin]].

## Notes from SkillCult Homestead

### Summary from [[Sources and Documentation/YT Vid A Look at Some Parent Apples That I use\|Apple Parents Video]]

Does well in NorCal climate, as opposed to [[Cox's Orange Pippin\|Cox's Orange Pippin]], in good years it has a strong cherry flavor reminiscent of cherry cough drops (in a good way). Good acid sugar balance, slightly towards the acid side. Good eating but doesn't keep very well. 

Main unique trait of interest is the cherry flavor. Interested in crossing with [[100 Trait Groups (Lines)/Red Fleshed Apples\|Red Fleshed Apples]], to create unique flavor combination of berries and cherries.
