# Summary

## Notes from SkillCult Homestead

When ripe is deeply red, but has a lot of problems, tends to be low in sugar, kind of acidic, tannic, goes mealy when ripe. But has great aromatic berry type flavors, like fruit punch^[[Skill Cult Video on Tasting His Crosses](https://youtu.be/2v0Z1ogqJv4?t=115)]

### Summary from [[Sources and Documentation/YT Vid A Look at Some Parent Apples That I use\|Apple Parents Video]]

Etter 7/13 is an intensely red fleshed apple, or dark dark pink. Very intense flavors of fruit punch and berries, but could use improvement.
